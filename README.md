<summary><h2>METHODOLOGY</h2></summary>
_These are basically the steps i followed for the project_


**1.Understanding the problem**
_Here we are asking and understanding what the company wants us to do_

For this project the company wanted to know the following questions:
-Condition of sales activity within the company
-Total revenue generated, 
-Revenue per state,
-Revenue per store,
-Revenue per category of items,
-Top 10 customers and 
-Best performing sales rep.

**Collecting and Gathering the Data**

Data was collected from their open source site, and i have uploaded the sql querry files which you can run to obtain the same.
To do it follow this process:
1. Open SQL server, create a new database and name it BikeStores
2. Select the new BikeStores database in the SQL server
3. Open the zip downloaded from the link I provided 
4. Open the 'create objects' query file and then execute it in the SQL server for the BikeStores database
5. Open the 'load data' query file and then execute it in the SQL server for the BikeStores database.

_NOTE: The query section of this project was done on SQL server Management Studio 19_


**Cleaning the data (if necessary)**

The data was already clean in this case so verification of the data was done here, which was to see for any missing or null values.


**Analyzing the data and creating visualizations**

The data was analyzed in Microsoft Excel,
The methodology followed here in brief was:
1.Importing data from SQL server to Excel via data import option. (_This was done so that the data remains linked to the SQL server pull, so any changes made there auto reflect here as well_)

- **Prerequisites**: None. This course is a great introduction for your first day on GitHub.
- **How long**: This course is four steps long and takes less than one hour to complete.

**Course tips:**

* Glossary terms will be _emphasised_ and linked to their definition.
